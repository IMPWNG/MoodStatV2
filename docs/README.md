# AI Response Component: 

This documentation explains the AIResponse component in a Next.js application using TypeScript and Supabase, along with the ChatGPT API.

## Overview

The AIResponse component is a chat-like interface that allows users to input their thoughts and feelings in a text area. When a user sends a message, the component sends the message to the ChatGPT API, which generates a response based on the user's input. Users can also filter their messages by date range to view their moods during a specific time period.


````
import { AiResponse } from '@/components/AiResponse';

// ... Inside a React component
<AiResponse moods={moodsArray} />
````

## Props

moods: An array of Mood objects representing the user's moods.


## Functions and States

1. useState hooks are used to manage local state variables:

response: An array of strings containing user messages and AI responses.

isLoading: A boolean to show a loading spinner while waiting for a response.

buttonDisabled: A boolean to disable the Resume button.

buttonColor: A string representing the Resume button's background color.

startDate, endDate: Strings representing the start and end dates for mood filtering.

userTyped: A boolean indicating whether the user has typed a message.

displayOnlyResponse: A boolean to show only the AI's response.



2. useEffect hooks are used to handle side effects:

Load moods and responses from local storage and set them to the corresponding state variables.

Save moods and responses to local storage whenever they change.



3. useCallback hooks are used to memoize functions:

getMoodsCategoryByDate: Returns moods filtered by the specified date range.

getMoodsDescription: Returns mood descriptions.



4. Event handlers:

handleInput: Sets userTyped to true when the user types in the input.

handleButtonClickResume: Sends a message with the user's moods to the ChatGPT API.

handleEnter: Handles the 'Enter' key press to submit the form.

handleSubmit: Sends the user's message to the ChatGPT API and stores the response.

saveToMemory: Saves data to local storage.

loadFromMemory: Retrieves data from local storage.

handleDateChange: Sets the start and end dates for mood filtering.

handleReset: Clears local storage and resets state variables.


## Component Structure

The component renders the following elements:

1. A MoodSearchByDate component to filter moods by date.
2. A loading spinner when waiting for a response.
3. A chat-like interface displaying user messages and AI responses.
4. A fixed input area at the bottom of the screen with:
  - A Resume button to send the user's moods to the ChatGPT API.
  - A Clear button to reset the component's state and local storage.
  - A text area for user input.
  - A Send button to submit the user's message.

## Summary
