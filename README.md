[V1](https://github.com/IMPWNG/MoodStats/edit/main/README.md)

## What new in V2

#### Style changes. 

For the V2, I have changed the style of the application. I opted for a more minimalistic approach. The UI is now more clean and easy to use. User can now use the application without any styling issues. The mobile version of the application is now more responsive.

#### New features. 

- Date picker: User can now select a date range to display their moods based on the date range. It is now possible to display the moods of a specific period.

- LongTerm, ShortTerm Memory: The AI now has a long term memory. The AI will now remember the moods of the user and will be able to predict the mood of the user based on the previous moods.

- ChatGPT parameters: I changed the parameters of the ChatGPT model. The model is now more accurate and will be able to predict the mood of the user better.

## What's next ?

- Optmise the application for mobile devices.
- Otpimise the code logic and implement a better code structure.
- Add more type of entries to gameify the application.
- Perform more tests on the AI model.
